Check the code thoroughly. we need some changes in how we are getting data. This is how we plan extract:
1) Spot daily data at end of the day. (around 3:45pm) - already implemented.
2) Spot LTP data every 1 minute. Use following method for the same-
        marketData=self.smart_api.getMarketData(mode, exchangeTokens)
3) Futures LTP data every 1 minute. Use the same method as above.
4) Options LTP ATM data every 1 minute. Use the same method as above.

getMarketData can handle 50 tokens at a time. one stock will have 1 spot, 1 future and 2 options. 
so plan to combine multiple stocks data into single request. store all the data in duckdb new tables. 

create test script which refreshes token(use existing script) and then download the data.


LTP SPOT-> Angel -> 15 seconds
LTP FUTURES -> Angel -> 15 seconds
LTP OPTIONS -> Angel -> 15 seconds
Greeks -> Calculated from LTP options -> 15 seconds
IV options -> Calculated from LTP options -> 15 seconds
52w high -> derived from LTP spot -> 15 seconds
52w low -> derived from LTP spot -> 15 seconds
200dma -> Historical data Till previous day -> 1 day
Breakout -> Historical data Till previous day -> 1 day
OI -> LTP options -> 15 seconds
OHLCV Spot -> Angel -> 15 seconds
OHLCV Futures -> Angel -> 15 seconds
OHLCV Options -> Angel -> 15 seconds

I want you to start on following task, create/update check list in project specification doc. go one
step at a time. e.g. 1, 4a, 3a in one go please.
1) scheduler will start this code around 9 am and end at 3:45 pm.
2) This code should start refreshing token data. (already implemented).
3) Download yesterday's data for all stocks and store in duckdb. (already implemented, but need to test refresh logic if same day rerun.)
        a) create new table with summarize data for each stock. calculate technical indicators for each stock. that new table should have 
           only one row per stock.
4) once market starts(9:15 am), start downloading LTP data for all stocks(every 5 seconds by default, configurable), options and futures.(function alredy implemented)
        a) getMarketData API supports 50 tokens at a time. so need to combine all stocks, options and futures data into single request.
        b) merge multiple stocks data into single request, if required.
        c) for single day, token value for spot and futures will be same. so need to handle this.
        d) As we are only storing ATM option data, we may need to calculate ATM strikes and corresponding token in every itreation.
           do nothing if token matches with last requrest, update the list in case new token is found.
        e) calculate greeks, IV etc. and store in duckdb.
